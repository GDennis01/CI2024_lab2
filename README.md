Some techniques implemented in my proposal were discussed and developed jointly with my [colleague]( https://github.com/FerraiuoloP/).
We started from the same template, then we devised together a way to implement a crossover mechanism that would work in our scenario and we sort of implemented it together(although our versions differ).
